         <p>NPDS has a simple but integrated banner manager into the system.<br />
         You can implement another banner system.<br />
         This one is simple enough that this help page will suffice.</p>
         <p>NPDS still implements a new function, banners linked to the user level.<br />
         A banner can actually be visible to everyone or to members or to administrators. It is even possible to temporarily deactivate a banner.<br />
         The interest of this function is to be able to differentiate the public...</p>
         <p>To <b>activate</b> the banner system: administration / Preferences to configure it.</p>

         <h4>Currently active banners:</h4>
         <p>This list shows you the activity of the banner campaigns currently running on your site and allows you to modify and/or delete a current campaign.</p>

         <h4>Banners completed:</h4>
         <p>When a campaign has reached the maximum number of impressions, it is moved to this list.<br />
         You can track the effectiveness of the campaign and delete it.</p>

         <h4>Advertising clients:</h4>
         <p>This list identifies customers (and their information) as well as the number of their banners in service.<br />
         This list allows you to modify and/or delete clients.</p>
         <p>Note:</b> If you wish to put a banner on unlimited display (number of impressions), enter 0 (zero) in the <i>Purchased Impressions</i> field.</p>

         <h4>Management of statistics by your customers:</h4>
         <p>A customer can consult their advertising campaign(s) on your site in real time.<br />To do this they have a username and password allowing them to connect on :
            <ul>
               <li><code>http://your_site/banners.php?op=login</code></li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>In these pages, your client can change the URLs of their banners (i.e. the page to which the user is sent when they click on the image), see their statistics in real time and request an automatic report by Email .</p>
