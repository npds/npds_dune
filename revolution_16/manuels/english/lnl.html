  <b>LNL - Little NewsLetter</b> 
</center>
<br />
<br />
This module lets you manage a little newsletter for your site. <br />
<br />
Its features are :<br />
&nbsp;- Management of LNL in 3 parts : header, body, footer,<br />
&nbsp;- Management of LNL in plain text or HTML,<br />
&nbsp;- LNL for members or/and anonymous that left their email adress using the 
lnl-block,<br />
&nbsp;- LNL'status.<br />
<br />
Basically it works this way :<br />
&nbsp;- Creation of a header (Text or Html),<br />
&nbsp;- Creation of a body (Text or Html),<br />
&nbsp;- Creation of a footer (Text or Html),<br />
&nbsp;- Test LNL (enter a number for each of the elements),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This test lets you preview the Newsletter<br />
&nbsp;- Send LNL (enter subject and members to send it to).<br />
<br />
You can add, modify or delete some parts of your Little NewsLetter.<br />
<br />
You can see the status of LNL already sent and in particular the following types 
: &nbsp;<br />
- All => LNL send to all members and anonymous that left their email adress using 
the lnl-block,<br />
- Mbr => sent only to members,<br />
- Out => only anonymous that left their email adress using the lnl-block,<br />
<br />
Also anonymous status (OK => Send me the LNL, NOK else).<br />
<br />
Of course, the Mail (or Email) function has to be activated by your hosting provider 
so you can use this feature. <br />
Above 50 members, the LNL will be sent by group of 50 every 10 seconds, this won't 
saturate your messagery server.<br />
