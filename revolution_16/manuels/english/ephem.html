  <b>Ephemerids</b> 
</center>
<br /><br />
What are they? Just events from the past...<br />
Some websites use this feature to remind the users what happened on that day years 
ago.<br />
This is really easy to use and used a block/boxe of the website. You need to activate 
this feature in the Preferences/settings module.<br />
<br />
<b>Add a past event :</b><br />
Select the day, the month, the year and a description of this event. For instance, 
you can create an event for 10/12/1429. When a user visits your site on 10/12 
the left block will display : C. Colombus discovers America. <br />
<br />
<b>Edit / Delete an ephemerid :</b><br />
Select the day and the month, then select the ephemerid you want to edit/delete.
