  <b> Administration Block/Box</b> 
</center>
<br /><br />
As an admin, you can activate a box/block (on the left or the right according 
to the theme you selected). You can't delete this block and you cannot duplicate 
it. <br />
<br />
Be creative and use it to store useful links like: New Article, Banners, ...<br />
You can insert HTML code as well (but no PHP ...).<br />
