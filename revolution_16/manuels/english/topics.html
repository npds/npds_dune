  <b>Topics Manager</b><br />
</center>
  <br />
You need to have set up a few topics to create articles. The topics manager allows 
you to manage your topics. This is a great feature of NPDS<br />
  <br />
Every topic requires a title, a description, an image (not required) and one (or 
more) administrator(s). <br />
  <br />
  <b>Add a topic :</b><br />
- Topic Name : this is for NPDS. Enter just a name without spaces - max: 20 characters. 
<br />
  <br />
  - Topic Text : This will be the Displayed Text. You can use both lower and upper 
  case and spaces. <br />
  <br />
  - Image : You don't have to but if your topic requires an image enter the name 
  of the file (i.e. : npds.gif). This file has to be in the <i>images/topics</i> 
  folder of your site<br />
  <br />
  - Administrator : NPDS allows to put one or more admin for a topic.<br />
  If you leave the field blank, ONLY
  SuperAdmins will be allowed to publish in this category.<br />
  If it has one or more (use , (commas) to separate the admins) => Only the admin(s)(and
  SuperAdmin) will get to publish articles in this topic.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Edit a Topic :</b><br />
  Click on the image or the text. The next page will let you change the Title,the 
  name, the description and the image.<br />
  You can delete a topic but this will delete all nested articles too!<br />
<br />
  You can add links to a topic, like a link to www.microsoft.com for a Windows 
  XP topic. This link will be available when viewing an article from that category.<br />
