         <p>This feature allows you to add users (members), to edit or delete them as well.</p>

         <h4>Add new user</h4>
         <p>Fill out the form. Required fields are marked with an * (Nickname, Email, Password).<br />
         Other fields are not mandatory. The hidden email adress is the one displayed to the other users (profile, forums, articles). NEVER PUT YOUR REAL EMAIL ADRESS in this field.<br />
         Click on Add user and NPDS will send an email with the password to the newly created user.
         </p>

         <h4>Member' role</h4>
         <p>You can attribute a specific role (for exemple : administrator, hot-line ...) to a member. the forum show this role and the administration of the role'list is in forum' config. </p>

         <h4>Group</h4>
         <p>A user can be a member of 0 to n groups and the group value is between 2(min) and 126(max). Groups are separated by a comma in the database.<br />
         - ex : 2,25 (member of groups 2 and 25)<br />
         The list of available groups is displayed and allows a multi-selection (shift / Ctrl).<br />
         The first choice allows to delete the membership to a group.<br />
         A group is a level-link that finds its meaning when creating blocks (see blocks).
         </p>

         <h4>Allow connexion</h4>
         <p>By default if the proper option is set to Yes in preferences, a member can log in as soon as he gets his password (email).<br />
         You can set it to off to forbid a member to access the website's members only features </p>

         <h4>Edit user</h4>
         <p>Enter his nickname, select <i>Modify</i> user and click on <i>Ok</i>.<br />
         You can therefore change everything (including the password).</p>

         <h4>Delete user</h4>
         <p>Enter his nickname, select Delete user and click on <i>Ok</i>.</p>

         <h4>Unsubscribe user</h4>
