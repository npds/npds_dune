the other users (profile, forums, articles). <b>NEVER PUT YOUR REAL EMAIL ADRESS 
in this field.</b><br />
Click on Add user and NPDS will send an email with the password to the newly created user.<br />

<b>Group :</b><br />
A user can be a member of 0 to n groups and the group value is between
2(min) and 126(max). Groups are separated by a comma in the database.<br />
