  <b>Faqs - Frequently Asked Questions</b> 
</center>
<br />
<br />
Setting up FAQS allows you to gain time! Some people may post messages in the 
forums again and again (i.e. : how to install your product? Why isn't the X function 
working under Windows XP, ...). <br />
<br />
The NPDS Faqs features requires at least one category.<br />
From the selected category, you can edit (create, edit and delete) every Q&amp;A 
pair. The answer field allows the use of HTML.<br />
<br />
As of NPDS 4.8 P3, they can display Php code, Perl, C... .<br />
You need to put your "source" between '[]' like this : <br />
<b>[code]your_source[/code]</b>.<br />
<br />
This function comes from phpBB. <br />
