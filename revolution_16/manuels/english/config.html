         <p>This feature is most important when starting a site with NPDS.You can modify all the important information on your site and above all give it the look and feeling you want. <br />Below is an explanation for important NPDS settings.</p> 
         <h5>Parse algorithm</h5> 
         <p>For your site preferences, you can choose either of the Parse functions.</p>
         <ul> 
            <li>FixQuotes is the original function that doubles the ['] (ex: art becomes art)</li> 
            <li>StripSlashes allows you not to touch the text (eg: art remains art) but can pose other problems.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p></p> 
         <h5>OB_Gzhandler</h5> 
         <p>Allows the use of sending compressed data to browsers that support compressed pages. <br />Before ob_gzhandler() sends the compressed data, it determines which encoding types are supported by the browser ("gzip", "deflate" or none) and returns the contents of the buffers appropriately.All browsers are processed, because it is up to the browsers to send a header indicating the supported page types. <br /> <span class="text-danger"><strong>Only works with active Zlib (do a phpinfo();) and for Apache, mod_gzip activated.</strong></span></p> 
         <h5>FileManager</h5> 
         <p>Enables or removes access to the FileManager.Please note, only activate the FileManager when you need it.</p> 
         <h5>Lifespan of admin and user cookies</h5> 
         <p>No comments (1 year = 8760 hours)</p> 
         <h5>name of the site</h5> 
         <p>Your site has a name, so enter it here.</p> 
         <h5>Site name for Title tag</h5> 
         <p>Title of the HTML pages of your site (especially for search engines)</p> 
         <h5>Site URL</h5> 
         <p>http://www.xxx.com or http://www.xxx.xom/~homepage/...</p> 
         <h5>Website logo</h5> 
         <p>.gif or .jpg file located in the <b>images</b> directory of your server (by default) or in one of your themes (full path: themes/mon_theme/..../logo.jpg for example). <br />This file is only used in NPDS printing functions.A good thing is to make an image in black and white.</p> 
         <h5>Site slogan</h5> 
         <p>If your site has a tagline, then this is the place to enter it.</p> 
         <h5>Site start date</h5> 
         <p>A date (01/20/2016 or January 31, 2016) which will only be visible in the statistics.</p> 
         <h5>Number of elements in page top x</h5> 
         <p>Allows you to configure the top x (5, 10, 15, ...).</p> 
         <h5>Number of articles on main page</h5> 
         <p>How many articles on one page? <br />A correct number is 10 but it depends on the activity of your site.Remember that registered members in NPDS can change this value, so this setting is just a default.</p> 
         <h5>Number of articles in the old articles box</h5> 
         <p>In the blocks on the right is the one that shows a list of old articles.This is the number you set here.</p> 
         <h5>Activate Export News</h5> 
         <p>Export-News are two text files located in the cache directory of your site.By default this parameter = no. <br />These two files (ultramode.txt and net2zone.txt) contain the 10 latest news from your site. <br />This file actually allows other sites to form information channels based on simple structures:</p>
         <ul> 
            <li>ultramode.txt is a text file where the news is separated by %%</li> 
            <li>net2zone.txt is a text file in net2zone XML format. <br />The "Online" function carrying out the same operation is <i>Backend</i> which supports the RDF/XML format or better still the NPDS Push Infos System module.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p></p> 
         <h5>Default name of anonymous</h5> 
         <p>Default name for <b>unregistered</b> users .Anonymous is a good value (but also guest, visitor...). <br />Do not change this value while NPDS is running.</p> 
         <h5>Authorize the creation of “news”</h5> 
         <p>Allows you to restrict (or not) the submission of news to moderators/administrators or members. <br />This function is interesting for an information site.</p> 
         <h5>Do not record authors' 'hits' in statistics</h5> 
         <p>Allows you not to count the maintenance of your site, as real visitors.</p> 
         <h5>Default site display theme</h5> 
         <p>Select the default theme for your site.Remember that registered users can change this option provided they make multiple themes available.</p> 
         <h5>Home Page</h5> 
         <p>This function allows you to configure the start page (home) of your site, by default the page is index.php (the article display system) but you can choose another function:</p>
         <ul> 
            <li>links.php</li> 
            <li>faqs.php</li> 
            <li>static.php?op=npds.txt&amp; <b>npds</b> =1 ... (the value of npds maybe -1: no blocks, 0: left block, 1: left and right blocks)</li> 
            <li>Editorial: 
              <ul> 
                  <li>index.php?op= <b>edito</b><br /> display of the editorial <b>and</b> the News system (without the next page link at the bottom of the news)</li> 
                  <li>index.php?op= <b>edito-nonews</b><br /> display of the editorial <b>without</b> the News system</li> 
                  <li>index.php?op= <b>newindex</b><br /> </li>
                  <li>display of the News system <b>without</b> the editorial (with the next page link at the bottom of the news)</li> 
                  <li>index.php?op= <b>edito-newindex</b><br /> display of the editorial <b>with</b> the news system (with the next page link at the bottom of the news)</li> 
                  <li>index.php?op= <b>newtopic&amp;topic=X</b> : display of the News system relating to the subject of id X <b>without</b> the editorial (with the next page link at the bottom of the news)</li> 
              </ul>
            </li>
         </ul> 
         <p></p> 
         <h5>Select site language</h5> 
         <p>No comments.</p> 
         <h5>Enable Multi-Language</h5> 
         <p>Allows NPDS to manage multiple languages ​​via the [language]...[/language] tags. <br />Remember to also configure Local Time (for example: [french]fr_FR[/french][english]en_EN[/english]).</p> 
         <h5>Local hour</h5> 
         <p>For a site under Windows, the value must be = french / Otherwise this field depends on the "local" functions normally installed under /usr/share/locale (for Unix).</p>
