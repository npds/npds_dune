When starting to use NPDS, this is the most important feature. You can edit major 
informations about your website and give it the look you want.<br />
<br />
Below are the key features of NPDS<br />
<br />

<center>
  <font color=Red><b>General site informations</b></font> 
</center>
<br />
<li> <b>Parse algo :</b> You can select one of those two Parse options.<br />
  - FixQuotes is the 'factory setting' option which doubles the ['] (i.e. : l'art 
  becomes l''art)<br />
  - StripSlashes allows to avoid the above problem (i.e. : l'art remains l'art) 
  but it may cause some malfunctions.</li>
<br />
<br />
<li> <b>OB_Gzhandler :</b> Allows to use compressed data to 'compressed data' 
  friendly browsers.<br />
  Before sending the compressed data, ob_gzhandler() determines what kind of compressed 
  data is supported by the browser ("gzip", "deflate" or none) then it sends back 
  the buffers' content according to the header information. It works with all 
  browsers as these browsers send the kind of compressed data is required.<br />
  <br />
  Only works with Php 4.05 (or >) + Active Zlib (perform a phpinfo();) and activate
  mod_gzip for Apache.</li>
<br />
<br />
<li> <b>FileManager :</b> Allows or disallow the FileManager access. Warning! 
  Use it only if you really need it</li>

  to use a black and white image.<br />
